Spanish youths receive cultural vouchers
The culture industry around the world suffered from the corona pandemic. In Spain, young people now receive EUR 400 vouchers to take advantage of cultural offers - but one type of event is excluded. 

To cushion the hardships of the corona pandemic, young people in Spain receive a cultural voucher . Everyone who will turn 18 next year should receive a voucher worth 400 euros from the government. But it cannot be used indefinitely: the recipients cannot buy tickets for bullfights with it.
The decision was one of the politically controversial measures the government included in the 2022 draft state budget. The vouchers are intended to help the country's culture and events industry recover from the loss of income during the corona lockdowns. According to the government, eligible teenagers can spend their 400 euros on cinema and theater tickets, books and concerts, for example.
The Ministry of Culture announced in a written communication to the state news agency Efe that "not everything that our legislation regards as culture will fall under this cultural support." Bullfighting is now rejected by a large part of Spanish society, especially young city dwellers.
